"""Synthetic weather for demo scenarios.

🔴 WHY THIS EXISTS, AND THE LINE IT MUST NOT CROSS.

Late blight needs cool, wet weather: Wallin's development range tops out at 26.6 C. Farrukhabad in
late August sits near 27 C in the wet hours, so every cell correctly comes back `safe` — the
physics is right and the product looks like it does nothing. Potato is a rabi crop there; the
season this model is built for is December-February, which a run in August cannot observe.

So this adapter synthesises the *inputs* for a named scenario and lets the REAL engine compute the
outputs. Nothing here decides a band, a DSV or a risk value — it only produces temperature,
humidity and rainfall series, exactly as a weather provider would. If the engine says `act`, that
is Hutton and Wallin agreeing on this weather, not a number someone typed in.

The line: a scenario artefact is written to its own district code, carries data_status
"scenario", and names the scenario in its degradation notes, so it surfaces in the UI as
synthetic. Real forecasts are never overwritten by a scenario run.
