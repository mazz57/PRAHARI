"""Assemble the farmer-facing field artefact.

🔴 Farmers fetch only THEIR OWN fields' advisories — a few KB (§29.6). The full district
GeoJSON is for the officer console. This module produces that small payload: one entry per
field, sorted worst-first (§21.1), each carrying its band, the numbers behind it, and the
four-part advisory in every configured language.

Pure dict assembly — no I/O, no clock. nightly.py writes the result.
